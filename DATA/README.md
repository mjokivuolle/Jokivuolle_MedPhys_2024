Library of pulsed gradient waveforms and simulated diffusion signals. Folder names of the data describe the parameters used to create the contents of each folder. Each folder under the Signals-directory contains 100 sub-folders named with numbers 1-100. Each of these folders contains the simulation results with 10 000 diffusing particles.

Use the visualization script under directory Code to visualize the simulated signals.
